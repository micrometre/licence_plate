# ANPR Image Preprocessing

This project demonstrates the key image preprocessing steps for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using OpenCV and Python, based on the article [ANPR Series Part 1: Advanced Image Preprocessing Techniques](https://henok.cloud/articles/anpr-part-1-image-preprocessing/).

## Features
- Step-by-step Jupyter notebook for ANPR image preprocessing
- Covers grayscale conversion, noise reduction, blurring, edge detection, morphological operations, and contour detection
- Visualizes each processing step for easy understanding

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### Usage
1. Place your sample image in the `sample_images/` directory (or update the path in the notebook).
2. Open `anpr_image_preprocessing.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run each cell to see the preprocessing pipeline in action.
